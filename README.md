# Rhetoric-School-Assigments-Macro

I made this set of VBA OpenOffice macros and used it until 2018. It automatically assigns talks to students in a rhetoric school (Life and Ministry school), prints assignments etc. It adds neat icons to the Calc toolbar to easily run the macros. Saved me much time! It runs in both OpenOffice and LibreOffice.
